## Why Deeds? 🤔

I created Deeds because I found myself wasting hours on social media, scrolling through reels and posts that added little value to my life. I wanted to create an app that would allow me to keep the same scrolling behavior but replace it with something more meaningful—reading the Quran. Deeds is designed to help you build a better habit while staying connected to your faith.
