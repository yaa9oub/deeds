- **Daily Verse**: Start your day with a thoughtfully selected verse to inspire and guide you.

## Why Deeds? ü§î

I created Deeds because I found myself wasting hours on social media, scrolling through reels and posts that added little value to my life. I wanted to create an app that would allow me to keep the same scrolling behavior but replace it with something more meaningful‚Äîreading the Quran. Deeds is designed to help you build a better habit while staying connected to your faith.
